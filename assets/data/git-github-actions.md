## Git Fundamentals: The What and Why

### What is Version Control?
A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that helps a software team manage changes to source code over time. It keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.

### What is Git?
Git is a **distributed version control system (DVCS)**. This means that every developer has a full copy of the entire repository, including its history, on their local machine. This makes it incredibly fast and allows developers to work offline.

### Core Git Concepts
- **Repository (Repo):** A directory where your project's files and their history are stored.
- **Commit:** A snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. Think of it as a save point.
- **Branch:** A lightweight movable pointer to a commit. You create branches to work on new features or bug fixes in isolation without affecting the main codebase (`main` or `master` branch).
- **HEAD:** A pointer that refers to the currently checked-out commit, which is usually the tip of the current branch.
- **Remote:** A version of your repository hosted on a server (like GitHub).

## Core Git Commands

*These are the commands you'll use every day.*

- **`git init`**
  - **What it does:** Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
  - **When to use:** When starting a new project from scratch.

- **`git clone <url>`**
  - **What it does:** Creates a local copy of a remote repository.
  - **When to use:** When you want to contribute to an existing project.

- **`git status`**
  - **What it does:** Shows the status of your working directory, including which files are modified, staged, or untracked.
  - **When to use:** All the time. It's your "are we there yet?" command.

- **`git add <file>`** or **`git add .`**
  - **What it does:** Adds changes from your working directory to the staging area. The staging area is where you prepare your next commit.
  - **When to use:** After you've made changes and are ready to commit them.

- **`git commit -m "Your descriptive message"`**
  - **What it does:** Takes the staged changes and saves them as a new commit in the repository's history.
  - **When to use:** After you've staged all the changes for a logical unit of work.

- **`git log`**
  - **What it does:** Shows a history of all the commits in the repository.
  - **When to use:** When you want to see the project's history.

- **`git pull`**
  - **What it does:** Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into your current branch. It's a combination of `git fetch` and `git merge`.
  - **When to use:** Before you start working, to make sure you have the latest changes.

- **`git push`**
  - **What it does:** Uploads your local commits to a remote repository.
  - **When to use:** When you want to share your changes with others.

## Branching and Merging

*This is the core of collaborative work in Git.*

### Why Branch?
Branching allows you to diverge from the main line of development and work on a feature or bug fix in isolation. This keeps the `main` branch clean and deployable at all times.

### Key Branching Commands
- **`git branch <branch-name>`**
  - **What it does:** Creates a new branch.

- **`git checkout <branch-name>`**
  - **What it does:** Switches your working directory to the specified branch.

- **`git checkout -b <branch-name>`**
  - **What it does:** A shortcut that creates a new branch and immediately switches to it.

- **`git merge <branch-name>`**
  - **What it does:** Combines the history of the specified branch into the current branch.
  - **Example:** To merge `feature-branch` into `main`, you would first `git checkout main`, then run `git merge feature-branch`.

### Handling Merge Conflicts
A merge conflict occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits. This happens when the same lines of code are changed in both branches.

**How to Resolve:**
1. Git will mark the conflicting files.
2. Open the files and look for the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
3. Edit the file to keep the desired changes and remove the markers.
4. Stage the resolved file with `git add <file>`.
5. Commit the merge with `git commit`.

## GitHub: Collaborative Development

### What is GitHub?
GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It adds a layer of collaboration and project management tools on top of Git, such as Pull Requests, Issues, and GitHub Actions.

### Key Features
- **Repositories:** Your project's home on GitHub.
- **Pull Requests (PRs):** A way to propose changes to a repository. It's a formal request to merge your branch into another branch.
- **Issues:** A tool for tracking tasks, bugs, and feature requests.
- **Forks:** A personal copy of someone else's repository. Forking allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

---

## The Pull Request (PR) Workflow

*This is the standard way to contribute to a project on GitHub.*

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create a personal copy of the project on your GitHub account.
2.  **Clone Your Fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
3.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`).
4.  **Make Changes:** Write your code and create your commits.
5.  **Push Your Branch:** Push your new branch to your forked repository on GitHub (`git push origin my-new-feature`).
6.  **Create a Pull Request:** Go to the original repository on GitHub. You'll see a prompt to create a PR from your new branch.
7.  **Code Review:** Team members will review your code, provide feedback, and request changes.
8.  **Merge:** Once the PR is approved, a repository maintainer will merge your changes into the main branch.

## GitHub Actions: Automating Your Workflow

### What is GitHub Actions?
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline right from GitHub.

### Core Concepts
- **Workflow:** An automated process defined by a YAML file in your repository's `.github/workflows` directory.
- **Event:** A specific activity that triggers a workflow (e.g., a `push` to a branch, a new `pull_request`).
- **Job:** A set of steps that execute on the same runner.
- **Step:** An individual task that can run commands or an action.
- **Action:** A reusable piece of code that can be used in a workflow (e.g., `actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-python`).
- **Runner:** A server that runs your workflows. GitHub provides hosted runners, or you can host your own.

## Building a CI Pipeline with GitHub Actions

Here is an example of a simple CI workflow that runs tests for a Python project on every push to the `main` branch or any pull request.

**File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Check out repository code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Run tests with pytest
      run: |
        pytest
```

**Explanation:**
- **`name`:** The name of the workflow.
- **`on`:** Specifies the events that trigger the workflow.
- **`jobs`:** Defines the jobs to be run.
- **`build-and-test`:** The ID of our single job.
- **`runs-on`:** Specifies the type of runner to use.
- **`steps`:** The sequence of tasks to be executed.
  - `actions/checkout`: Checks out your repository code so the workflow can access it.
  - `actions/setup-python`: Sets up a specific version of Python.
  - `Install dependencies`: Runs shell commands to install project dependencies.
  - `Run tests`: Runs the test suite.

## Best Practices

### Git Best Practices
- **Write Meaningful Commit Messages:** A good commit message explains *why* a change was made, not just *what* was changed.
- **Make Small, Frequent Commits:** It's easier to understand and review small, atomic commits that focus on a single logical change.
- **Don't Commit Generated Files:** Avoid committing build artifacts, log files, or IDE configuration files. Use a `.gitignore` file to exclude them.

### GitHub Best Practices
- **Write Clear PR Descriptions:** Explain the purpose of your PR and link it to any relevant issues.
- **Review Your Own PR First:** Before requesting a review, read through your own changes to catch any mistakes.

### GitHub Actions Best Practices
- **Use Secrets for Sensitive Data:** Store tokens, passwords, and API keys as encrypted secrets in your repository settings.
- **Pin Actions to a Specific Version:** Use a specific version of an action (e.g., `actions/checkout@v3`) instead of `@main` to prevent unexpected changes from breaking your workflow.

## Interview Preparation

### Common Git Questions
- **Q: What is the difference between `git merge` and `git rebase`?**
  - **A:** `git merge` creates a new "merge commit" that ties together the histories of both branches. It's non-destructive. `git rebase` rewrites the commit history by replaying commits from one branch onto another, creating a linear history. It can be dangerous if used on shared branches.
- **Q: What is `git stash`?**
  - **A:** `git stash` temporarily shelves (or stashes) changes you've made to your working copy so you can work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them later on.
- **Q: How do you undo the last commit?**
  - **A:** `git reset --soft HEAD~1` will undo the last commit but keep the changes in your staging area. `git reset --hard HEAD~1` will discard the commit and all changes.

### Common GitHub Questions
- **Q: Explain the fork and pull request model.**
  - **A:** It's a collaborative model where developers fork a repository, make changes in their own copy, and then submit a pull request to the original repository to have their changes merged.
- **Q: What is a `.gitignore` file?**
  - **A:** It's a file that tells Git which files or directories to ignore in a project. This is used to avoid committing generated files or sensitive information.

### Common GitHub Actions Questions
- **Q: How would you set up a workflow to run tests only when a PR is created?**
  - **A:** You would use the `on: pull_request` event trigger in your workflow YAML file.
- **Q: How do you pass data between jobs in a workflow?**
  - **A:** You can use `outputs` to define data that a job produces and `needs` to access that data in a dependent job. For sharing files, you can use the `actions/upload-artifact` and `actions/download-artifact` actions.
