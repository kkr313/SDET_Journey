## Manual Testing Fundamentals

### What is Software Testing?
**Definition:** Software Testing is the process of evaluating a software application to ensure it meets the specified requirements and is free of defects.

**Purpose:**
- **Quality Assurance:** Ensure product meets quality standards
- **Defect Prevention:** Identify and prevent defects early
- **Risk Mitigation:** Reduce business and technical risks
- **User Satisfaction:** Ensure positive user experience
- **Compliance:** Meet regulatory and business requirements

**Testing Principles:**
1. **Testing shows presence of defects, not absence**
2. **Exhaustive testing is impossible**
3. **Early testing saves time and money**
4. **Defect clustering** - 80% of defects found in 20% of modules
5. **Pesticide paradox** - Same tests won't find new bugs
6. **Testing is context dependent**
7. **Absence of errors fallacy** - Bug-free doesn't mean usable

**Example:** Testing a food delivery app for search, cart, payment, and tracking features.

### What is Manual Testing?
**Definition:** Manual Testing is a type of software testing where test cases are executed manually by human testers without automation tools.

**Characteristics:**
- **Human Intelligence:** Requires human observation and judgment
- **Exploratory Nature:** Can discover unexpected issues
- **User Perspective:** Tests from actual user viewpoint
- **Flexible Approach:** Can adapt testing approach on-the-fly
- **Cost Effective:** No initial tool setup costs

**Manual vs Automated Testing:**

| Aspect | Manual Testing | Automated Testing |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| **Human Intervention** | Required | Minimal |
| **Speed** | Slower | Faster |
| **Accuracy** | Prone to human error | Highly accurate |
| **Cost** | Higher long-term | Higher initial setup |
| **Exploratory Testing** | Excellent | Limited |
| **Regression Testing** | Time-consuming | Efficient |
| **UI/UX Testing** | Better for visual validation | Limited visual testing |

**When to Use Manual Testing:**
- **Exploratory Testing:** When requirements are unclear
- **Usability Testing:** For user experience validation
- **Ad-hoc Testing:** Random testing scenarios
- **Initial Testing:** New feature validation
- **Complex Scenarios:** Business logic validation

## Test Design Techniques

### Black Box Testing Techniques

- **Example:** Age field (0-17: Minor, 18-65: Adult, 65+: Senior)

**Test Data:**
- Valid partition: 25 (Adult)
- Invalid partitions: -5, 150

**2. Boundary Value Analysis**
- **Definition:** Test values at boundaries of equivalence partitions
- **Principle:** Defects often occur at boundaries
- **Example:** Age field boundaries

**Test Data:**
- Lower boundary: 17, 18, 19
- Upper boundary: 64, 65, 66

**3. Decision Table Testing**
- **Definition:** Systematic way to capture business rules
- **Use:** Complex business logic with multiple conditions
- **Example:** Insurance premium calculation

| Age | Gender | Smoker | Premium |
|-----|--------|--------|---------|
| <25 | Male   | Yes    | High    |
| <25 | Male   | No     | Medium  |
| <25 | Female | Yes    | Medium  |
| <25 | Female | No     | Low     |

**4. State Transition Testing**
- **Definition:** Test based on state changes
- **Use:** Applications with different states
- **Example:** ATM machine states

States: Idle â†’ Card Inserted â†’ PIN Entered â†’ Authenticated â†’ Transaction
Events: Insert Card, Enter PIN, Withdraw, Eject Card

**5. Error Guessing**
- **Definition:** Based on tester's experience and intuition
- **Approach:** Guess where errors might occur
- **Examples:**
  - Empty fields
  - Special characters
  - Very long inputs
  - Null values

### White Box Testing Techniques

**1. Statement Coverage**
- **Goal:** Execute every statement at least once
- **Formula:** (Executed Statements / Total Statements) Ã— 100

**2. Branch Coverage**
- **Goal:** Execute every branch (true/false) at least once
- **Also Called:** Decision coverage

**3. Path Coverage**
- **Goal:** Execute every possible path through the code
- **Most comprehensive but complex

### Real-World Test Design Example

**Feature:** User Registration Form

**Requirements:**
- Username: 6-20 characters, alphanumeric
- Password: 8-16 characters, must include special character
- Email: Valid email format
- Age: 18-99

**Test Cases Using Different Techniques:**

**Equivalence Partitioning:**
- Valid username: "user123"
- Invalid username: "u" (too short), "verylongusername123" (too long)

**Boundary Value Analysis:**
- Username: "user12" (6 chars), "user1234567890123456" (20 chars)
- Age: 17, 18, 19, 98, 99, 100

**Decision Table:**
| Username Valid | Password Valid | Email Valid | Expected Result |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Yes | Yes | Yes | Registration Success |
| No | Yes | Yes | Username Error |
| Yes | No | Yes | Password Error |
| Yes | Yes | No | Email Error |

## Usability Testing

### Usability Principles

**Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics:**
1. **Visibility of system status**
2. **Match between system and real world**
3. **User control and freedom**
4. **Consistency and standards**
5. **Error prevention**
6. **Recognition rather than recall**
7. **Flexibility and efficiency of use**
8. **Aesthetic and minimalist design**
9. **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**
10. **Help and documentation**

### Usability Testing Methods

**1. Moderated Testing**

- More natural behavior, less expensive

**3. A/B Testing**
- Compare two versions
- Quantitative results
- Good for specific design decisions

**4. Guerrilla Testing**
- Quick, informal testing
- Public spaces, coffee shops
- Fast feedback, low cost

### Usability Test Scenarios

**E-commerce Example:**
1. **Find a specific product** (information architecture)
2. **Add item to cart** (interaction design)
3. **Complete checkout** (conversion flow)
4. **Track order** (post-purchase experience)

**Banking App Example:**
1. **Check account balance** (core functionality)
2. **Transfer money** (critical task)
3. **Pay bills** (common task)
4. **Find ATM** (location services)

### Usability Metrics

**Effectiveness:**
- Task completion rate
- Error rate
- Quality of outcome

**Efficiency:**
- Time on task
- Number of steps
- Number of errors

**Satisfaction:**

**Q2: Explain the difference between verification and validation.**
**A:** 
- **Verification:** "Are we building the product right?" - Checks if software conforms to specifications through reviews, inspections, and walkthroughs
- **Validation:** "Are we building the right product?" - Ensures software meets user needs through actual testing

**Q3: What is the difference between severity and priority?**
**A:**
- **Severity:** Impact of the defect on the system (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- **Priority:** Urgency to fix the defect from business perspective (P1, P2, P3, P4)

**Example:** A spelling mistake on company logo has Low severity but High priority.
