SELECT order_id, 
       (quantity * unit_price) as expected_total,
       total as actual_total
FROM order_items
WHERE (quantity * unit_price) != total;
```

#### 2. Test Data Setup
```python
# Python example with pytest fixture
@pytest.fixture

    """)
    user_id = cursor.lastrowid
    
    yield user_id  # Provide to test
    
    # Cleanup: Remove test data
    cursor.execute("DELETE FROM users WHERE id = ?", (user_id,))
    db_connection.commit()
```

#### 3. Data Cleanup
```sql
-- Clean up old test data
DELETE FROM test_orders WHERE created_at < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY);

-- Reset test account
UPDATE users SET balance = 1000 WHERE email LIKE '%@test.com';
```

import { check, sleep } from 'k6';

export let options = {
  vus: 100,
  duration: '5m',
};

export default function () {
  let res = http.get('https://api.example.com/products');
  check(res, {
    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
    'response time < 500ms': (r) => r.timings.duration < 500,
  });
  sleep(1);
}
```

**When to use:** Modern APIs, DevOps teams, Kubernetes environments

#### Locust (Python-based)
**Pros:**
- Python scripting (easy to learn)
- Distributed load generation

class WebsiteUser(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(1, 3)
    
    @task(3)
    def view_products(self):
        self.client.get("/products")
    
    @task(1)
    def view_product_detail(self):
        self.client.get("/products/123")
```

**When to use:** Python teams, custom scenarios, complex user behaviors

### Types of Performance Testing

#### 1. Load Testing
**Goal:** Test system behavior under expected load
- Simulate normal and peak user traffic
- Verify system meets performance requirements
- Example: 1,000 concurrent users for 30 minutes

#### 2. Stress Testing
**Goal:** Find the breaking point
- Gradually increase load beyond normal capacity
- Identify maximum operating capacity
- Observe system degradation behavior
- Example: Ramp up from 100 to 5,000 users

#### 3. Spike Testing
**Goal:** Test system reaction to sudden load increases
- Sudden jump in concurrent users
- Common during flash sales, marketing campaigns
- Example: Jump from 100 to 2,000 users instantly

#### 4. Soak Testing (Endurance Testing)
**Goal:** Find memory leaks and resource exhaustion
- Run moderate load for extended period
- Monitor system resources over time
- Example: 500 users for 24-48 hours

#### 5. Scalability Testing
**Goal:** Test system's ability to scale
- Gradually increase load
- Monitor resource utilization
- Determine if adding resources improves performance

### Key Performance Metrics

#### Response Time Metrics
- **Average Response Time:** Mean of all response times (can be misleading)
- **Median (50th percentile):** Middle value, better than average
- **90th Percentile:** 90% of requests faster than this
- **95th Percentile:** 95% of requests faster than this
- **99th Percentile:** 99% of requests faster than this (catches outliers)

**Why percentiles matter:**
- Average = 200ms might hide that 10% of requests take 5+ seconds
- 95th percentile = 500ms means 95% of users experience <= 500ms

#### Throughput Metrics
- **Requests Per Second (RPS):** How many requests handled per second
- **Transactions Per Second (TPS):** How many business transactions completed
- **Hits Per Second:** Total HTTP requests (including resources)

#### Error Metrics
- **Error Rate:** Percentage of failed requests
- **Error Types:** 4xx (client errors) vs 5xx (server errors)
- **Timeout Rate:** Requests that exceeded timeout threshold

#### Resource Utilization
- **CPU Usage:** % of CPU capacity used
- **Memory Usage:** RAM consumption over time
- **Network I/O:** Bandwidth usage
- **Disk I/O:** Read/write operations

### Monitoring & APM Tools

#### Grafana + Prometheus
- Real-time metrics visualization
- Custom dashboards
- Alerting capabilities
- Open-source, highly customizable

#### New Relic
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- Distributed tracing
- Real User Monitoring (RUM)

### Best Practices

1. **Test in Production-like Environment:** Match production specs (servers, network, database)
2. **Start Small:** Begin with small load, gradually increase
3. **Define Success Criteria:** Set clear SLAs (e.g., 95th percentile < 500ms, error rate < 1%)
4. **Monitor Backend:** Don't just measure response times, monitor servers
5. **Test Regularly:** Include in CI/CD, not just before releases
6. **Analyze Bottlenecks:** Use profiling tools to find slow code
7. **Test Realistic Scenarios:** Use real user patterns, not just homepage hits

## 6️⃣ CI/CD & DevOps for Testers

**Goal:** Automate the entire testing pipeline and integrate testing seamlessly into the software delivery process.

**Duration:** 4–6 months

### Version Control with Git

#### Git Fundamentals
**Basic Commands:**
```bash
git init                    # Initialize repository
git clone <url>            # Clone remote repository
git add .                  # Stage changes
git commit -m "message"    # Commit changes
git push origin main       # Push to remote
git pull                   # Fetch and merge changes
```

**Branching:**
```bash
git branch feature/test-automation  # Create branch
git checkout feature/test-automation # Switch to branch
git checkout -b feature/new-tests   # Create and switch

git merge feature/test-automation   # Merge branch
git branch -d feature/test-automation # Delete branch
```

**Advanced Git:**
```bash
git rebase main            # Rebase on main branch
git cherry-pick <commit>   # Pick specific commit
git stash                  # Save changes temporarily
git reset --hard HEAD~1    # Undo last commit
```

#### Branching Strategies
**Git Flow:**
- `main` → Production-ready code
- `develop` → Integration branch
- `feature/*` → New features
- `hotfix/*` → Production fixes
- `release/*` → Release preparation

**GitHub Flow (Simpler):**
- `main` → Always deployable
- `feature/*` → Feature branches
- Pull Requests for all changes

**Trunk-Based Development:**
- Everyone commits to `main` frequently
- Short-lived feature branches (< 1 day)
- Feature flags for incomplete features

#### Pull Request Best Practices
- Small, focused changes (< 400 lines)
- Clear description with context
- Link to related tickets/issues
- Request specific reviewers
- Respond to feedback professionally
- Ensure CI passes before requesting review

### CI/CD Platforms

            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            parallel {
                stage('Unit Tests') {
                    steps {
                        sh 'mvn test'
                    }
                }
                stage('Integration Tests') {
                    steps {
                        sh 'mvn verify -Pintegration'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh './deploy.sh staging'
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        always {
            junit '**/target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
            publishHTML([reportDir: 'reports', reportFiles: 'index.html'])
        }
    }
}
```

#### GitHub Actions
**Pros:**
- Native GitHub integration
- Free for public repos, generous free tier
- YAML-based, easy to learn
- Huge marketplace of pre-built actions

**Workflow Example:**
```yaml
name: Test Suite
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        browser: [chrome, firefox, safari]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test -- --browser=${{ matrix.browser }}
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        if: failure()
        with:
          name: test-screenshots
          path: screenshots/
```

#### GitLab CI/CD
**Pros:**
- Integrated with GitLab
- Built-in Docker registry
- Powerful pipeline features
- Auto DevOps capabilities

**`.gitlab-ci.yml` Example:**
```yaml
stages:

  stage: test
  script:
    - pytest tests/unit
  coverage: '/TOTAL.*\s+(\d+%)$/'

e2e_tests:
  stage: test
  services:
    - selenium/standalone-chrome
  script:
    - pytest tests/e2e
  artifacts:
    when: on_failure
    paths:
      - screenshots/
```

### Containerization with Docker

#### Why Docker for Testing?
- ✅ **Consistent Environments:** Same environment on dev, CI, and prod
- ✅ **Isolation:** Tests don't affect each other
- ✅ **Fast Startup:** Spin up test environments in seconds
- ✅ **Version Control:** Infrastructure as code

#### Dockerfile for Test Environment
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Install dependencies
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Install browsers for Selenium
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    chromium \
    chromium-driver \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy test code
COPY . .

# Run tests
CMD ["pytest", "tests/", "--html=report.html"]
```

#### Docker Compose for Integration Tests
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    image: myapp:latest
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - db
  
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: testpass
      POSTGRES_DB: testdb
  
  tests:
    build: ./tests
    depends_on:
      - web
    environment:
      BASE_URL: http://web:3000
    command: pytest tests/integration
```

**Running:**
```bash
docker-compose up --abort-on-container-exit tests
```

### Kubernetes Basics (Advanced)

**Why Kubernetes for Testing:**
- Run tests in production-like environment
- Parallel test execution at scale
- Dynamic resource allocation

**Test Job Example:**
```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: e2e-tests
spec:
  parallelism: 5
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: tests
        image: my-tests:latest
        env:
        - name: TEST_ENV
          value: "staging"
      restartPolicy: Never
```

### Building a Complete CI/CD Pipeline

**Typical Test Pipeline Stages:**

1. **Code Commit** → Developer pushes code
2. **Build** → Compile code, download dependencies
3. **Static Analysis** → Linting, code quality (SonarQube)
4. **Unit Tests** → Fast, isolated tests (< 5 min)
5. **Integration Tests** → Test component interactions
6. **API Tests** → Test backend services
7. **UI Tests** → Test user interface (parallel execution)
8. **Security Scan** → Check for vulnerabilities
9. **Performance Tests** → Load/stress tests (nightly)
10. **Deploy to Staging** → Automatic deployment
11. **Smoke Tests** → Quick health check
12. **Deploy to Production** → Manual approval or automatic

**Quality Gates:**
- All tests must pass
- Code coverage > 80%
- No critical security vulnerabilities
- Performance metrics within SLA

### Best Practices

1. **Fast Feedback:** Keep pipeline under 15 minutes for quick tests
2. **Fail Fast:** Run fastest tests first
3. **Parallel Execution:** Run tests in parallel to save time
4. **Flaky Test Management:** Quarantine or fix flaky tests immediately
5. **Environment Parity:** Make test environments match production
6. **Artifact Storage:** Save test reports, screenshots, videos
7. **Notifications:** Alert team on failures (Slack, email)
8. **Metrics:** Track test execution time, flakiness, coverage

## 7️⃣ System Design & Microservices Testing

**Goal:** Understand modern distributed systems architecture to design effective testing strategies for complex, distributed applications.

**Duration:** 4–6 months

### Microservices Architecture Fundamentals

#### What are Microservices?
**Monolith vs. Microservices:**
- **Monolith:** Single, large application with all features
- **Microservices:** Multiple small, independent services that communicate

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Independent deployment
- ✅ Technology diversity (different services can use different languages)
- ✅ Better scalability
- ✅ Fault isolation

**Challenges:**
- ❌ Distributed system complexity
- ❌ Network reliability issues
- ❌ Data consistency challenges
- ❌ More difficult to test end-to-end

#### Key Components

**API Gateway:**
- Single entry point for all clients
- Routing, authentication, rate limiting
- Request aggregation
- Examples: Kong, AWS API Gateway, Azure API Management

**Service Discovery:**
- Services register themselves
- Clients discover service locations dynamically
- Examples: Consul, Eureka, Kubernetes Service Discovery

**Load Balancer:**
- Distributes traffic across service instances
- Health checks, failover
- Examples: Nginx, HAProxy, AWS ALB

**Message Queues (Async Communication):**
- **Kafka:** High-throughput, distributed streaming
- **RabbitMQ:** Traditional message broker
- **AWS SQS:** Managed queue service
- **Redis Pub/Sub:** Lightweight messaging

**Circuit Breakers & Resilience:**
- Prevent cascading failures
- Fail fast when downstream service is down
- Libraries: Hystrix, Resilience4j, Polly

### Testing Strategies for Microservices

#### Testing Pyramid for Microservices

```
        /\
       /  \  E2E Tests (few, slow, expensive)
      /    \
     /------\  API/Service Tests (more, faster)
    /        \
   /----------\  Unit Tests (many, fast, cheap)
  /____________\
```

**Distribution:**
- 70% Unit Tests (individual functions, components)
- 20% Service/API Tests (single service with mocked dependencies)
- 10% End-to-End Tests (complete user flows across services)

#### Contract Testing (Critical for Microservices)

**Problem:** Service A expects API format from Service B, but Service B changes it → breaks in production

**Solution:** Consumer-driven contract testing with Pact

**How It Works:**
1. Consumer defines expectations (contract)
2. Contract is verified against Provider
3. Both sides commit to honoring the contract

**Pact Example (JavaScript):**
```javascript
// Consumer test
const { Pact } = require('@pact-foundation/pact');

describe('User Service Consumer', () => {
  const provider = new Pact({
    consumer: 'OrderService',
    provider: 'UserService'
  });

  it('gets user details', async () => {
    await provider.addInteraction({
      uponReceiving: 'a request for user',
      withRequest: {
        method: 'GET',
        path: '/users/123'
      },
      willRespondWith: {
        status: 200,
        body: {
          id: 123,
          name: 'John Doe',
          email: 'john@example.com'
        }
      }
    });

    // Test your code that calls UserService
  });
});

// Provider verification
const { Verifier } = require('@pact-foundation/pact');

new Verifier({
  providerBaseUrl: 'http://localhost:8080',
  pactUrls: ['path/to/pact.json']
}).verifyProvider();
```

**Benefits:**
- Catches breaking changes early
- No need to run all services for integration testing
- Clear API documentation through contracts

#### Service Virtualization

**Problem:** Can't run all dependent services in every test environment

**Solution:** Mock/stub external services

**WireMock (Java):**
```java
@Test
public void testOrderCreation() {
    // Mock UserService response
    stubFor(get(urlEqualTo("/users/123"))
        .willReturn(aResponse()
            .withStatus(200)
            .withHeader("Content-Type", "application/json")
            .withBody("{\"id\":123,\"name\":\"John\"}")));
    
    // Test OrderService that depends on UserService
    Response response = orderService.createOrder(123, items);
    assertEquals(201, response.getStatus());
}
```

**Hoverfly (Go-based):**
```python
from hoverpy import HoverPy

with HoverPy(capture=True) as hoverpy:
    # Record real interactions
    response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/users/123")

# Replay recorded interactions in tests
with HoverPy(simulate=True) as hoverpy:
    response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/users/123")
    # Gets mocked response
```

#### End-to-End Integration Testing

**Challenge:** Testing across multiple services is complex and slow

**Strategies:**

**1. Simplified E2E (Testing Key Flows):**
```
User Service → Order Service → Payment Service → Notification Service
     |              |                |                    |
  [Real]        [Real]           [Mock]              [Mock]
```
- Only test critical paths end-to-end
- Mock non-critical external services
- Run in dedicated test environment

**2. Consumer-Driven E2E:**
- Each team responsible for their service tests
- Contract tests ensure compatibility
- Minimal full-stack E2E tests

### System Design Concepts for Testing

#### Scalability
**Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling:**
- **Vertical:** Add more CPU/RAM (limited)
- **Horizontal:** Add more instances (preferred for microservices)

**Testing Scalability:**
- Load test with increasing concurrent users
- Monitor response times at different scales
- Test auto-scaling triggers

#### High Availability (HA)
**Concepts:**
- Multiple instances (no single point of failure)
- Load balancing across availability zones
- Failover mechanisms

**Testing HA:**
- Chaos engineering (shut down instances randomly)
- Test failover scenarios
- Verify zero downtime during deployments

#### Fault Tolerance
**Patterns:**
- **Retry:** Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Timeout:** Don't wait forever for response
- **Circuit Breaker:** Stop calling failing service
- **Bulkhead:** Isolate resources to prevent cascading failures

**Testing Fault Tolerance:**
```python
# Test circuit breaker
def test_circuit_breaker():
    # Make service fail
    mock_service.fail()
    
    # Multiple calls should trigger circuit breaker
    for i in range(10):
        response = client.call_service()
    
    # Circuit should be open now
    assert circuit_breaker.state == "OPEN"
    
    # Calls should fail fast without hitting service
    response = client.call_service()
    assert response.status == 503  # Service Unavailable
```

#### CAP Theorem
**You can only have 2 of 3:**
- **Consistency:** All nodes see same data
- **Availability:** System responds to requests
- **Partition Tolerance:** System works despite network splits

**Testing Implications:**
- Test behavior during network partitions
- Verify eventual consistency in distributed systems
- Test conflict resolution strategies

#### Event-Driven Architecture
**Patterns:**
- **Event Sourcing:** Store events, not just current state
- **CQRS:** Separate read and write models
- **Saga Pattern:** Distributed transactions across services

**Testing Event-Driven Systems:**
```python
# Test saga pattern (distributed transaction)
def test_order_saga():
    # 1. Create order
    order_id = order_service.create_order(items)
    
    # 2. Reserve inventory
    wait_for_event("InventoryReserved", order_id)
    
    # 3. Process payment
    wait_for_event("PaymentProcessed", order_id)
    
    # 4. Verify order completed
    order = order_service.get_order(order_id)
    assert order.status == "COMPLETED"

def test_saga_failure_compensation():
    # Force payment failure
    payment_service.inject_failure()
    
    # Create order
    order_id = order_service.create_order(items)
    
    # Verify compensation (inventory released)
    wait_for_event("InventoryReleased", order_id)
    assert order.status == "FAILED"
```

#### Effective Communication with Developers
**Do:**
- ✅ Provide clear, reproducible steps
- ✅ Include logs, screenshots, and environment details
- ✅ Suggest possible root causes (based on your analysis)
- ✅ Understand their perspective and constraints
- ✅ Ask clarifying questions before assumptions

**Don't:**
- ❌ Say "it doesn't work" without details
- ❌ Blame developers for bugs
- ❌ Report bugs without verifying they're real
- ❌ Assume something is obvious

**Example - Poor:**
> "The login is broken. Please fix it."

**Example - Good:**
> "Login fails when using email with + symbol (e.g., user+test@gmail.com). 
> Steps: 1) Go to /login, 2) Enter email with +, 3) Click Login.
> Expected: Successful login. Actual: 400 Bad Request error.
> Logs attached. Might be related to email validation regex.
> Environment: Staging, Chrome 120, Windows 11."

#### Communication with Stakeholders
**Product Managers:**
- Translate technical issues to business impact
- Provide risk assessment for features
- Suggest testability improvements early in design

**Management:**

### Risk Analysis & QA Strategy

#### Risk-Based Testing
**Assess Risk Factors:**
- **Business Impact:** Revenue-critical features
- **Complexity:** New technology, complex logic
- **Change Frequency:** Areas that change often
- **Past Defects:** Bug-prone modules

**Prioritization Matrix:**
```
        High Impact
            |
    High    |    Medium
   Priority |   Priority
------------|------------
    Medium  |     Low
   Priority |   Priority
            |
        Low Impact
```

**Example:**
- **High Impact + High Probability = Critical** → Payment processing
- **High Impact + Low Probability = Important** → Admin features
- **Low Impact + High Probability = Monitor** → UI cosmetic issues
- **Low Impact + Low Probability = Ignore** → Rarely used legacy features

#### Building a QA Strategy
**Components:**
1. **Test Approach:** What types of testing (unit, API, UI, performance)
2. **Automation Strategy:** What to automate, what to keep manual
3. **Tool Selection:** Frameworks, CI/CD, reporting tools
4. **Test Environments:** Dev, staging, production-like
5. **Quality Gates:** Criteria for release (coverage, pass rate)
6. **Metrics:** How to measure quality and progress

**Example Strategy:**
```
Goal: Enable weekly releases with 99.9% uptime

Approach:
- 80% test coverage (unit + integration)
- Automated API tests for all endpoints
- Automated UI tests for critical flows only
- Performance tests in staging (weekly)
- Security scans on every build

Quality Gates:
- All tests pass
- Code coverage > 80%
- No critical security vulnerabilities
- Performance within SLA (p95 < 500ms)

Metrics:
- Defect escape rate (target < 2%)
- Test execution time (target < 15 min)
- Mean time to detect (MTTD) < 1 hour
- Mean time to resolve (MTTR) < 4 hours
```
