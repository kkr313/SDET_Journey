## Getting Started with SDET

Welcome to your journey as a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET)! This guide will help you understand the fundamentals and get started on the right path.

## What is an SDET?

An SDET is a software engineer who specializes in testing. Unlike traditional QA roles, SDETs have strong programming skills and can:

- Design and develop test automation frameworks
- Write code to test code
- Participate in software design discussions
- Understand both development and testing perspectives
