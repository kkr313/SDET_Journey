# Data Structures & Algorithms

## Introduction

Master the essential data structures and algorithms for technical interviews and efficient problem-solving.

## Data Structures

### Linear Data Structures
- **Arrays**: Fixed-size sequential collection
- **Linked Lists**: Dynamic node-based structure
- **Stacks**: LIFO (Last In First Out)
- **Queues**: FIFO (First In First Out)

### Non-Linear Data Structures
- **Trees**: Hierarchical structure
  - Binary Trees
  - Binary Search Trees (BST)
  - AVL Trees
  - Heaps
- **Graphs**: Network of nodes and edges
- **Hash Tables**: Key-value pairs

## Common Algorithms
