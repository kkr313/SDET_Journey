## Study Plan

### Week 1-2: Arrays & Strings
Focus on basic array manipulation and string problems.

### Week 3-4: Linked Lists & Stacks
Master pointer manipulation and stack-based problems.

### Week 5-6: Trees & Graphs
Learn traversal techniques (DFS, BFS).

### Week 7-8: Dynamic Programming
Build foundation with classic DP problems.

### Week 9-10: Advanced Topics
Tackle harder problems combining multiple concepts.

## Practice Tips

1. **Time Yourself**: Aim for 20-30 minutes per problem
2. **Understand, Don't Memorize**: Focus on patterns
3. **Write Clean Code**: Follow best practices
4. **Test Edge Cases**: Empty inputs, single elements, large inputs
5. **Optimize**: Start with brute force, then optimize
6. **Review**: Revisit problems after a week
