## Introduction to the SDET Role

### What is an SDET?
An **SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test)** is a hybrid role that combines the skills of a software developer with those of a quality assurance tester. Unlike traditional testers who focus on manual and black-box testing, an SDET is deeply involved in the development process, writes code for automation, and helps build robust, scalable testing infrastructure.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- **Automate Everything:** Design, develop, and maintain automated test scripts.
- **Develop Frameworks:** Build and enhance test automation frameworks.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Integrate testing into the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Code Reviews:** Participate in code reviews to improve testability and quality.
- **Tool Development:** Create testing tools and utilities for the development team.
- **Quality Advocacy:** Champion quality best practices across the engineering organization.

### SDET vs. Manual Tester vs. Automation Engineer

## Phase 1: Mastering Quality Assurance Fundamentals

*Before you can automate, you must understand what to test and why.*

### Core Testing Concepts
- **STLC & SDLC:** Understand the Software Testing Life Cycle and its place in the Software Development Life Cycle.
- **Testing Types:** Functional, Non-Functional, Regression, Smoke, Sanity, etc.
- **Test Design:** Equivalence Partitioning, Boundary Value Analysis, Decision Tables.
- **Defect Management:** Bug life cycle, severity vs. priority, effective bug reporting.

> **Action Item:** Review the **[Manual Testing Concepts Guide](./?topic=manual-concepts)** to solidify your foundational knowledge.

---

## Phase 2: Learning to Code

*Code is your primary tool. Master it.*

### Choose a Programming Language
Most SDET roles require proficiency in one of the following. **Python** and **Java** are the most popular choices.

| Language | Pros for SDETs | Cons for SDETs |
|---|---|---|
| **Python** | Easy to learn, huge libraries (Pytest, Requests), great for scripting. | Dynamically typed, can be slower. |
| **Java** | Strongly typed, robust, vast ecosystem (Selenium, TestNG, REST-Assured). | More verbose, steeper learning curve. |
| **JavaScript** | Dominant in web (Cypress, Playwright), good for full-stack testing. | Asynchronous nature can be complex. |

### Core Programming Concepts
- **Variables & Data Types:** (int, string, boolean, etc.)
- **Operators:** (arithmetic, logical, comparison)
- **Control Flow:** (if/else, loops, switch)
- **Functions/Methods:** (parameters, return values)
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
    - **Classes & Objects:** The blueprint and the instance.
    - **Inheritance:** Reusing code from other classes.
    - **Polymorphism:** Objects taking many forms.
    - **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods.
- **Data Structures:**
    - **Arrays / Lists:** Ordered collections.
    - **Maps / Dictionaries:** Key-value pairs.
    - **Sets:** Unique element collections.
- **Exception Handling:** (try/catch blocks)

---

## Phase 3: Core Automation Skills

*This is where you apply your coding skills to automate tests.*

### UI Automation
Automating the user interface of web applications.

**Key Tools:**
- **Selenium:** The industry standard, supports multiple languages, cross-browser.
- **Cypress:** Modern JavaScript framework, fast, reliable, great for developers.
- **Playwright:** Developed by Microsoft, supports multiple languages, excellent for modern web apps.

**Core UI Automation Concepts:**
- **Locators:** Finding elements on a page (ID, Name, CSS Selector, XPath).
    - **Best Practice:** Prefer stable locators like `data-testid` over fragile ones like XPath.
- **Waits:** Handling dynamic content.
    - **Implicit Wait:** Global wait for elements.
    - **Explicit Wait:** Wait for a specific condition (e.g., element is clickable).
    - **Fluent Wait:** Configurable explicit wait.
- **Page Object Model (POM):** A design pattern to create a repository of web elements, making code cleaner and more maintainable.
- **Handling Actions:** Clicks, text input, dropdowns, alerts, frames.

### Mobile Automation
Automating native, hybrid, and mobile web applications.

**Key Tool:**
- **Appium:** Open-source, based on Selenium WebDriver protocol, supports iOS and Android.

**Core Mobile Automation Concepts:**
- **Setup:** Appium Server, Desired Capabilities, Emulators/Simulators.
- **Locators:** `accessibilityId`, `id`, `name`, `xpath`.
- **Gestures:** Swiping, tapping, scrolling, pinch-to-zoom.

---

## Phase 4: API and Services Testing

*Testing the backend is often more efficient and stable than UI testing.*

### What is API Testing?
Testing the business logic layer of the application without a user interface. It's faster, more stable, and allows for earlier testing in the development cycle.

**Key Concepts:**
- **HTTP Methods:** `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`.
- **Status Codes:** `200 OK`, `201 Created`, `400 Bad Request`, `404 Not Found`, `500 Server Error`.
- **API Formats:** `JSON`, `XML`.
- **Authentication:** `Basic Auth`, `API Keys`, `OAuth`.

### API Testing Tools
- **Postman:** Excellent for manual and exploratory API testing.
- **REST-Assured (Java):** A powerful library for writing API automation in Java.
- **Requests (Python):** The standard library for making HTTP requests in Python.

**Example API Test (Python with `requests`):**
```python
import requests

def test_get_user():
    response = requests.get("https://reqres.in/api/users/2")
    assert response.status_code == 200

    user_data = response.json()
    assert user_data['data']['id'] == 2
    assert user_data['data']['email'] == "janet.weaver@reqres.in"
```

## Phase 5: DevOps and CI/CD Integration

*An SDET ensures quality is built into the development pipeline, not just checked at the end.*

### What is CI/CD?
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Developers merge code changes into a central repository frequently, after which automated builds and tests are run.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD):** Automatically releasing code changes to a testing or production environment after the build stage.

**SDET's Role in CI/CD:**
- **Automated Test Execution:** Configure test suites (Smoke, Regression) to run automatically on every code commit.
- **Quality Gates:** Define criteria (e.g., "95% tests must pass") that must be met for a build to proceed to the next stage.
- **Reporting:** Integrate test results and reports into the CI/CD dashboard.

### Key Tools
- **Git:** Version control is non-negotiable. Master `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `merge`, `rebase`.
- **Jenkins:** The most popular open-source CI/CD server.
- **GitLab CI/GitHub Actions:** CI/CD built directly into your code repository.
- **Docker:** Containerization to create consistent, isolated test environments.

**Example CI/CD Pipeline with Testing:**
`Code Commit` -> `Build` -> `Unit Tests` -> `Deploy to Staging` -> `API Tests` -> `UI Tests` -> `Deploy to Production`

## Phase 6: Advanced Automation Concepts

*Move from writing scripts to building scalable, maintainable automation solutions.*

### Test Automation Frameworks
A set of guidelines, tools, and libraries that provide a structure for creating and managing automated tests.

**Key Components:**
- **Test Runner:** (TestNG, JUnit, Pytest) - Executes tests and provides assertions.
- **Reporting:** (Allure, ExtentReports) - Generates detailed test execution reports.
- **Configuration Management:** Handling test data, environment URLs, etc.
- **Utilities:** Reusable functions for logging, database connections, etc.

**Types of Frameworks:**
- **Linear:** Record and playback (not recommended).
- **Modular:** Breaking down tests into smaller, independent modules.
- **Data-Driven:** Separating test data from test logic (e.g., using Excel, CSV).
- **Keyword-Driven:** Using keywords to represent actions, good for non-technical users.
- **Hybrid:** A combination of the above, most commonly used.

### Design Patterns in Test Automation
- **Page Object Model (POM):** Separates UI elements from test logic.
- **Singleton Pattern:** Ensuring a class has only one instance (e.g., for a WebDriver instance).
- **Factory Pattern:** Creating objects without specifying the exact class (e.g., creating a browser driver).

## Phase 7: Non-Functional Testing

*Go beyond "does it work?" to "how well does it work?".*

### Performance Testing
- **Goal:** To evaluate the speed, responsiveness, and stability of an application under a specific workload.
- **Key Metrics:** Response Time, Throughput, Error Rate, CPU/Memory Usage.
- **Tools:**
    - **JMeter:** Open-source, Java-based, very popular.
    - **Gatling:** Modern, code-based performance testing tool.
    - **k6:** Developer-friendly, scriptable in JavaScript.

### Security Testing
- **Goal:** To identify vulnerabilities and protect the application from threats.
- **Key Concepts (OWASP Top 10):**
    - **Injection:** (e.g., SQL Injection).
    - **Broken Authentication:** Flaws in login/session management.
    - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into web pages.
- **Tools:**
    - **OWASP ZAP:** Open-source security scanner.
    - **Burp Suite:** A comprehensive platform for web application security testing.
